<!-- Icon Setup Guide for To-do List Extension

This folder should contain three PNG icon files in different sizes:

1. icon-16.png   (16x16 pixels) - Small icon used in extension list
2. icon-48.png   (48x48 pixels) - Medium icon used in dialogs
3. icon-128.png  (128x128 pixels) - Large icon used in Chrome Web Store

To create these icons quickly:

Option 1: Using an online tool
- Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Upload your image
- Download the PNG files
- Rename them to match the above filenames

Option 2: Using image editing software
- Create a 128x128 PNG image (can use GIMP, Photoshop, Paint.NET, etc.)
- Scale down and save as 16x16 and 48x48

Option 3: Simple workaround for development
- Create simple SVG or use emoji as placeholder
- Convert to PNG using https://convertio.co/

Suggested design:
- Color: Purple gradient or checkmark symbol
- Style: Flat design, modern look
- Example: Checkmark (✓) on purple background

Once you have the icon files, the extension will display them:
- In the Chrome extension menu (16x16)
- In extension settings (48x48)
- In your manifest (128x128 for potential store listing)

The extension will work without icons, but it's recommended to add them for a professional look.
